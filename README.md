# Hypothesis
Using stock price historical data, we can accurately predict past stock prices based on key metrics of the time (using all previous information available before the historical point we are trying to predict the price at, make our prediction, and then check it against the actual historical price) and be within roughly 20% of the actual historical price.


# Research Question
How do we build the most accurate stock price prediction model, and what data is the most important to collect for this prediction?
